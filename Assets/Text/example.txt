Player|That's terrible, Taichi! Have you spoken to the professor for help?|
Taichi|Well, he's kinda intimidating. I wouldn't want to push his buttons too much.|embar_00
Player|How about you come and study with me!|
Player|That way, you'll be able to ace your next exam!|
Taichi|Gee...you really mean it? W-w-well that would be GREAT!|offerhug_00
